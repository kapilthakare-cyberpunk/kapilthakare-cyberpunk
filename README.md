## 👋 Hi, I’m @kapilthakare-cyberpunk

- 👀 I’m interested in photography gear, Linux tinkering, backup scripting, and trying out cool open-source tools before they trend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to automate Android backups, build better workflows on Linux Mint, and make .desktop files feel like magic buttons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on lightweight tools for creators, open-source utilities for rentals/logistics, and documentation-friendly scripts that even my future self will thank me for.
- 📫 How to reach me: kapilsthakare@primesandzooms.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I rent out cinema cameras by day, script on Linux by night, and still find time to test random AppImages just for fun.
